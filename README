This is version 0.8.0 of the GNUstep nib2gmodel tool

   GNUstep is a set of general-purpose Objective-C libraries based on
the OpenStep standard developed by NeXT (now Apple) Inc. The libraries
consist of everything from foundation classes, such as dictionaries and
arrays, to GUI interface classes such as windows, sliders, buttons, etc.

   nib2gmodel is a tool developed for GNUstep which converts Apple/NeXT
OpenStep 4.x and MacOSX nib files (and perhaps other nib files) to the
GNUstep version of a nib file called a gmodel file.

   Note that nib2gmodel does a pretty good, but not a perfect job of
translating nib files. Since the nib format is not documented,
translation must be done in a round-about way. Coupled with the fact
that different OpenStep systems store GUI elements in different ways
leads to non-optimal translation.  It is likely that you'll have to
hand-edit the gmodel file after translation (Until our interface
manager, Gorm gets up to speed).

   The file `INSTALL' gives instructions for installing the package.

   The GNUstep web site at <http://www.gnustep.org> contains more
information.
