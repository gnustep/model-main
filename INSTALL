This file documents the installation of the GNUstep nib2gmodel tool.

   Copyright (C) 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  You may copy,

   This is version 0.6.6 of nib2gmodel.

Installing `nib2gmodel'
=======================

   The nib2gmodel tool runs on OpenStep 4.x and MacOSX Server. It's
possible it will run on other versions of OPENSTEP, but it has not been
tried yet.

   Here is a quick-and-dirty example of installation commands:

     ./configure
     make
     make install

   type

     ./configure --help

   for special options you can add to configure.

   By default, the nib2gmodel program is intalled in /usr/local/bin.

   Ignore any messages about "Cannot find libtiff library" during
configuration.  The libtiff library is not needed for nib2gmodel.

Converting nibs
===============

   To convert a nib file, simply type something like

     nib2gmodel MyNib.nib MyNib.gmodel

   Make sure you have installed the binary and it is in your path. Note
that you have to be logged in to an OpenStep terminal (such that the
program can connect to the window server).
