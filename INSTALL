Installing `gnustep'
====================

   The nib2gmodel tool runs on OpenStep 4.x and MacOSX Server. It's
possible it will run on other versions of OPENSTEP, but it has not been
tried yet.

   Here is a quick-and-dirty example of installation commands:

     ./configure
     make
     make install

   type

     ./configure --help

   for special options you can add to configure.

   By default, the nib2gmodel program is intalled in /usr/local/bin.

   Ignore any messages about "Cannot find libtiff library" during
configuration.  The libtiff library is not needed for nib2gmodel.
