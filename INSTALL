Installation
************

This file documents the installation of the GNUstep nib2gmodel tool.

   Copyright (C) 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  You may copy,

notice and permission notice.

   This is version 0.5.5 of GNUstep.

Installing `gnustep'
====================

   The nib2gmodel tool only runs on OpenStep 4.x. It's possible it will
run on other versions of OPENSTEP, such as MacOS X, but it has not been
tried yet.

   Here is a quick-and-dirty example of installation commands:

     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/GNUstep
     make
     make install

   type

     ./configure --help

   for special options you can add to configure.

   The nib2gmodel program is intalled in a deep directory structure. For
instance, on a m68k OpenStep 4.x system, it is installed in
`/usr/local/GNUstep/Tools/m68k/nextstep4/nx-nx-nx-nil/nib2gmodel'.  You
may want to link this file to /usr/local/bin to make it easier to use.
In the future, we may offer a "shallow" install feature to put it
automatically in /usr/local/bin (or a similar dir).
