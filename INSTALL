Installation
************

This file documents the installation of the GNUstep nib2gmodel tool.

   Copyright (C) 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  You may copy,

notice and permission notice.

   This is version 0.11.0 of nib2gmodel.

Installing `nib2gmodel'
=======================

   The nib2gmodel tool runs on OpenStep 4.x and MacOSX 10.x. It's
possible it will run on other versions of OPENSTEP, if there are any,
but it has not been tried yet.

   Here is a quick-and-dirty example of installation commands:

     ./configure
     gnumake
     gnumake install

   Note that on some OpenStep systems you must use `gnumake' instead of
`make', since the standard make does not have the correct GNU
extensions.  For special options you can add to configure, type

     ./configure --help

   By default, the nib2gmodel program is intalled in /usr/local/bin.

Converting nibs
===============

   To convert a nib file, simply type something like

     nib2gmodel MyNib.nib MyNib.gmodel

   Make sure you have installed the binary and it is in your path. Note
that you have to be logged in to an OpenStep terminal (such that the
program can connect to the window server).
