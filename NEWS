Noteworthy changes in version `0.5.6'
=====================================

   Some of the translation problems have been fixed. Still needs better
testing.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.5.5'
=====================================

   This is the first release of the nib2gmodel tool on its own. It was
previouly (and still is) a part of the core libraries.

   There are known problems with this release. Worst of all being that
nib2gmodel doesn't completely convert all GUI Objects, such as
Matrices, etc. Hopefully a fixed up version will be coming soon.
