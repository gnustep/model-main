This is version @value{NIB2MOD-VERSION} of the GNUstep nib2gmodel tool

GNUstep is a set of general-purpose Objective-C libraries based on the
OpenStep standard developed by NeXT (now Apple) Inc. The libraries
consist of everything from foundation classes, such as dictionaries and
arrays, to GUI interface classes such as windows, sliders, buttons, etc.

nib2gmodel is a tool developed for GNUstep which converts Apple/NeXT
OpenStep 4.x and MacOSX nib files (and perhaps other nib files) to the GNUstep
version of a nib file called a gmodel file.

The file @file{INSTALL} gives instructions for installing the package.

The GNUstep web site at @url{http://www.gnustep.org} contains more 
information.
