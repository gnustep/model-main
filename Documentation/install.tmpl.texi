This file documents the installation of the GNUstep nib2gmodel tool.

This is version @value{NIB2MOD-VERSION} of GNUstep.

@section Installing @samp{gnustep}

The nib2gmodel tool runs on OpenStep 4.x and MacOSX Server. It's possible it 
will run on other versions of OPENSTEP, but it has not been
tried yet.

Here is a quick-and-dirty example of installation commands:

@example
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/GNUstep
make
make install
@end example

type 

@example
./configure --help
@end example

for special options you can add to configure. 

The nib2gmodel program is intalled in a deep directory structure. For
instance, on a m68k OpenStep 4.x system, it is installed in
@file{/usr/local/GNUstep/Tools/m68k/nextstep4/nx-nx-nx-nil/nib2gmodel}.
You may want to link this file to /usr/local/bin to make it easier to
use. In the future, we may offer a "shallow" install feature to put
it automatically in /usr/local/bin (or a similar dir).

Ignore any messages about "Cannot find libtiff library" during configuration.
The libtiff library is not needed for nib2gmodel.
