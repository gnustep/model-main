This file documents the installation of the GNUstep nib2gmodel tool.

This is version @value{NIB2MOD-VERSION} of nib2gmodel.

@section Installing @samp{nib2gmodel}

The nib2gmodel tool runs on OpenStep 4.x and MacOSX Server. It's possible it 
will run on other versions of OPENSTEP, but it has not been
tried yet.

Here is a quick-and-dirty example of installation commands:

@example
./configure
gnumake
gnumake install
@end example

Note that on many OpenStep systems you must use @samp{gnumake} instead
of @samp{make}, since the standard make does not have the correct GNU
extensions.  For special options you can add to configure, type 

@example
./configure --help
@end example

By default, the nib2gmodel program is intalled in /usr/local/bin.

Ignore any messages about "Cannot find libtiff library" during configuration.
The libtiff library is not needed for nib2gmodel.

@section Converting nibs

To convert a nib file, simply type something like

@example
nib2gmodel MyNib.nib MyNib.gmodel
@end example

Make sure you have installed the binary and it is in your path. Note
that you have to be logged in to an OpenStep terminal (such that the program
can connect to the window server).
