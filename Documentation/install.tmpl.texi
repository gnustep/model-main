@section Installing @samp{gnustep}

The nib2gmodel tool runs on OpenStep 4.x and MacOSX Server. It's possible it 
will run on other versions of OPENSTEP, but it has not been
tried yet.

Here is a quick-and-dirty example of installation commands:

@example
./configure
make
make install
@end example

type 

@example
./configure --help
@end example

for special options you can add to configure. 

By default, the nib2gmodel program is intalled in /usr/local/bin.

Ignore any messages about "Cannot find libtiff library" during configuration.
The libtiff library is not needed for nib2gmodel.
