The currently released version is @samp{@value{NIB2MOD-VERSION}}.

@section Noteworthy changes in version @samp{0.5.5}

This is the first release of the nib2gmodel tool on its own. It was
previouly (and still is) a part of the core libraries.

There are known problems with this release. Worst of all being that nib2gmodel
doesn't completely convert all GUI Objects, such as Matrices, etc. Hopefully
a fixed up version will be coming soon.
