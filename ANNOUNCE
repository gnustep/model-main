What is nib2gmodel?
===================

This is version 0.6.1 of the GNUstep nib2gmodel tool

   GNUstep is a set of general-purpose Objective-C libraries base on the
OpenStep standard developed by NeXT (now Apple) Inc. The libraries
consist of everything from foundation classes, such as dictionaries and
arrays, to GUI interface classes such as windows, sliders, buttons, etc.

   nib2gmodel is a tool developed for GNUstep which converts Apple/NeXT
OpenStep 4.x nib files (and perhaps other nib files) to the GNUstep
version of a nib file called a gmodel file.

   The file `INSTALL' gives instructions for installing the package.

   The GNUstep web site at `http://www.gnustep.org' conatins more
information.

   For documentation on individual libraries, look in the documentation
section/directory for that library.

   The GNUstep libraries are covered under the GNU Public Library
License.  This means you can use these libraries in any program (even
non-free programs) as long as you make the source and improvements you
have made to the libraries freely available. You should read the
COPYING.LIB file for more information.

   GNUstep tools, test programs, and other files are covered under the
GNU Public License. This means if you make changes to these programs,
