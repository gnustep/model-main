What is nib2gmodel?
===================

README
******

This is version 0.5.6 of the GNUstep nib2gmodel tool

   GNUstep is a set of general-purpose Objective-C libraries base on the
OpenStep standard developed by NeXT (now Apple) Inc. The libraries
consist of everything from foundation classes, such as dictionaries and
arrays, to GUI interface classes such as windows, sliders, buttons, etc.

   nib2gmodel is a tool developed for GNUstep which converts Apple/NeXT
OpenStep 4.x nib files (and perhaps other nib files) to the GNUstep
version of a nib file called a gmodel file.

   The file `INSTALL' gives instructions for installing the package.

   The GNUstep web site at `http://www.gnustep.org' conatins more
information.

   For documentation on individual libraries, look in the documentation
section/directory for that library.

   The GNUstep libraries are covered under the GNU Public Library
License.  This means you can use these libraries in any program (even
non-free programs) as long as you make the source and improvements you
have made to the libraries freely available. You should read the
COPYING.LIB file for more information.

   GNUstep tools, test programs, and other files are covered under the
GNU Public License. This means if you make changes to these programs,
you cannot charge a fee, other than distribution fees, for others to
use the program. You should read the COPYING file for more information.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

   The nib2model-0.5.6.tar.gz distribution file has been placed on
`ftp.gnustep.org' in `pub/gnustep/dev-apps'.

   The `.tar' file is compressed with GNU gzip.  Gzip can be obtained by
anonymous ftp at any of the GNU archive sites.

   For info about FTP via email, send email to `ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com'
with no subject line, and two-line body with line one `help' and line
two `quit'.

   The most recent (not necessarily tested) snapshots of GNUstep will be
placed on `{No Value For "GNUSTEP-SNAP-FTP-MACHINE"}' in
`{No Value For "GNUSTEP-SNAP-FTP-DIRECTORY"}'.

Where do I send bug reports?
============================

   Bug reports can be sent to <bug-gnustep@gnu.org>.

Obtaining GNU Software
======================

   Check out the GNU web site. (`http://www.gnu.org/')

   Check out the GNUstep web site. (`http://www.gnustep.org/')

   Most GNU software is packed using the GNU `gzip' compression program.
Source code is available on most sites distributing GNU software.

   For information on how to order GNU software on tape, floppy or
cd-rom, or printed GNU manuals, check the file etc/ORDERS in the GNU
Emacs distribution or in GNUinfo/ORDERS on prep, or e-mail a request to:
<gnu@gnu.org>

   By ordering your GNU software from the FSF, you help us continue to
develop more free software.  Media revenues are our primary source of
support.  Donations to FSF are deductible on US tax returns.

   The above software will soon be at these ftp sites as well.  Please
try them before `ftp.gnu.org' as it is very busy!

   thanx <gnu@gnu.org>
